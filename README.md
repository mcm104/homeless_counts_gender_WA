# trans_homeless_counts_WA

_This dataset was created as a final project for the University of Washington Information School's Winter 2021 course on data curation._

This dataset contains the results of point-in-time homelessness counts in Washington state from 2015 to 2019. The counts are broken up by gender and housing status. The source data provides three gender categories: female, male, and transgender. In 2017, a fourth category was added for gender nonconforming persons. In this dataset you will find the counts for all four categories, as well as counts and percentages within each category for those in emergency shelters, those in transitional housing, and those who are unsheltered. The intended audience for this dataset is policymakers at the municipal, county, and state level in Washington state.
